# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, first go on discord and then you have 2 options :

### MP Minheur2000

First join our discord (https://discord.gg/wCTcVnJFmx) then find Min_heur2000's profile (name in red, if I'm online I should be at the top of the users list).
You can directly send me a message (DM open).

### Create a ticket on the discord

You first have, again, to join the discord (https://discord.gg/wCTcVnJFmx) then accept the rules (big green button with written, in french : "Accepter le règlement". It is on the second channel, called "『🧾』・règlement).
When you get a message in blue with role membre added to you, you can go in the category "💬・Général" (turn on "see all channels" in serveur parameters if needed to see it) then go in the channel "🎫・ticket".
Puch the blue button to create a ticket. Explain (in english or french) that you found a vulerability **without** esplaining it directly. You will be notified with an @ in a channel of your name all away down the channels list when it will be aprouved.
Then explain the vulnerability **when Min_heur2000 ask you to** and only him.

### Create a private security alert

Go in the "security" tab on the GitHub repository.
Create a private discution.
Admins or maintainters only will be able to read and speak with you to understand and patch the bug.
